[quarto_titlepages](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages) is a Quarto extension for creating custom cover pages and title pages for PDF output. Pre-defined themes are available, but all themes can be customized. Static pages for copyright, dedication, etc. can be added after the title page. LaTeX users see footnote[^1].

[^1]: If you want to pass in your own title page or cover page files without using the extension framework see [quarto_titlepages_v1](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages_v1).

From command line, to install into a new directory:

``` bash
quarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages
```

To add to an existing directory or update the extension if there have been new releases, cd to the directory and then:

``` bash
quarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages
```
